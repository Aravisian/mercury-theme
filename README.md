Mercury-GTK

Mercury for XFCE linux desktop.Cinnamon or Mate Desktop.
Includes theme for Stark menu, Cinnamenu, Whiskermenu or ZorinMenuLite

This uses skeumorphism with the effect of 3D bubble-like buttons. Probably because I have been working so much with flat monochromatic themes, I needed to make this to take the edge off. It quickly became a favorite of mine.
Which is interesting, because aside from a blue toned Rubberband, the theme is black and white over-all - with whichever icon set you use to Set The Color Tone for the theme. 

Fix Firefox:
Open "Customize Toolbar" and check the box for "titlebars".

Other Web browsers: Often, you can right click on the titlebar and select "Use System Titlebars".
